# Svelte Music Player

## How this works
This music player uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/), [TypesafeI18n](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n), and [Hygraph (CMS)](https://hygraph.com).

To use it as it is, you can fork this project, host it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (like I do), and create your content on Hygraph. Once you have your content ready, you should create a .env file (look into the .env.example), and also put the same env variables in your Vercel project configuration.

This way, you can have multiple albums using a single project.
